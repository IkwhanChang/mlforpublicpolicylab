## Introduction to the goals of the Class 
[Slides](Class1-Overview.pptx)

We’ll  provide  an  introduction  to  the  class,  its  goals,  and  an  overview  of  the project options to help you decide what you’re interested in working on for the remainder of the semester.

Notes for Tuesday:
- Different from previous iterations of the course, project-driven
- Note that there isn't a single lecture on the syllabus about ML methods, class is about everything that happens before and after building a model, which is where you spend most of your time anyway
- There are no comprehensive readings -- the readings we've selected for each class speak to elements of the topics, but lectures will be important to get a more complete understanding

## ML Project Scoping 

[Slides](lecture2-scoping.pptx)

We’ll talk about scoping, problem definition, and understanding and balancingorganizational goals.  Well before the outset of technical work, a decision needs to be madeabout whether a given policy problem can and should be addressed with machine learning:is the problem significant, feasible to solve with a technical approach, and of sufficient im-portance to policy makers that they will devote resources to implementing the solution? Howwill success be measured? How will (often competing) goals of efficiency, effectiveness, andequity be balanced?
