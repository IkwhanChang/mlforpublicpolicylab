## ssh
`ssh your_andrew_id@mlpolicylab.dssg.io`
ssh is what you'll use to connect to the class server, which is where you will do all the work. You will need to give us your ssh key, using the instructions we sent, and then you'll be good to go. Based on which operating system you're using, you can google for which tool is the best (command line, terminal, putty, etc.)
