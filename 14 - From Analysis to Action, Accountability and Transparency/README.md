This week will be the last week of deep dive presentations. By this
week, your group should be well into the process of preparing your
final report and presentation. 

**Due Thursday, Apr. 23**: Draft field trial design for your final report.

For a machine learning practitioner, developing a model is only one
aspect of the job. They must also be able to communicate about what
their models can and (importantly) cannot achieve to  non-technical
stakeholders, as well as develop a strategy for deploying their mod-
els in a manner that allows for ongoing monitoring of performance and
equity measures along with continual improvement through feedback
about errors. Too often overlooked (especially when "black box" models
are deployed by third party contractors to agencies with little capac-
ity to maintain them), these considerations are critical to the
long-term success of a project. Both practitioners and researchers of
machine learning and artificial intelligence addition- ally have a
responsibility to act in an ethical way and consider the broader
social impact of their work. However, reasonable people can disagree
on exactly what constitutes ethical behavior and transparency isn’t
necessarily a goal in its own right (nor even desirable in all cases,
such as where bad actors could game a system).
