By this week, your group should have a preliminary set of "correct but
crappy" results reflect- ing a relatively simple model grid and the
features you prioritized to build as a first pass. So you think you
have a great model, you’ve "validated" it on holdout data, and you’re
all ready to go&#x2026; Models can fail to generalize to novel data
data in a multitude of ways and this week we’ll be exploring some of
the reasons that things can go wrong in building models for real-world
deployment. Issues like overfitting and leakage can threaten the
external validity of your model even in the context of a stable world,
but changes in policies and data collec- tion techniques pose
considerable challenges as well.
