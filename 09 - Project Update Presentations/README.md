## Project Update Presentations
By this week, your group should have a preliminary set of “correct but crappy” results reflecting a relatively simple model grid and the features you prioritized to build as a first pass.

**Due Monday, Oct 26:** Weekly project update with validation splits, matrices, and “version 0” results.

This  week,  each  group  will  give  a  presentation  about  the  current  status  of  their  project, covering the problem setting, approach, and initial results.  The presentations will be split between the Tuesday and Thursday Sessions. On Wednesday, we’ll continue our group check-ins and sometime this week we’ll hold an additional tech session with a deep dive on building modeling pipelines.
