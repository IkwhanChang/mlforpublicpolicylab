Work on your project during this week should include continuing to develop and refine yourscope as you begin to explore the data. You’ll also need to prepare and load some data into adatabase in order to make use of it in your modeling.

Tuesday of this week will provide a crash course in exploratory data analysis.  Data explo-ration is fundamental to developing an understanding of the nuances of the data and howthe policy problem you initially scoped can be specifically formulated as a machine learningproblem.  This process involves generating and plotting summary statistics, exploring trendsover time and understanding rapid changes in distributions, as well as identifying missingdata and outliers. Typically, data exploration should involve considerable input from domainexperts as you develop an understanding of how the data relates to the underlying generativeprocess, as well as its idiosyncrasies and limitations.

On Thursday, we’ll describe the components of typical machine learning pipelines. End-to-endML Pipelines can quickly become unwieldy with several moving pieces and well-structured,modular code is often critical to detecting and fixing bugs in the process.  This session willprovide an overview of the pipeline, each underlying element, and some best practices forbuilding them.
