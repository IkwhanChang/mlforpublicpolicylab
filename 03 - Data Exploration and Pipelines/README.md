Work on your project during this week should include continuing to develop and refine your scope as you begin to explore the data. You’ll also need to prepare and load some data into adatabase in order to make use of it in your modeling.

Tuesday of this week will provide a crash course in exploratory data analysis.  Data exploration is fundamental to developing an understanding of the nuances of the data and how the policy problem you initially scoped can be specifically formulated as a machine learning problem.  This process involves generating and plotting summary statistics, exploring trend sover time and understanding rapid changes in distributions, as well as identifying missing data and outliers. Typically, data exploration should involve considerable input from domain experts as you develop an understanding of how the data relates to the underlying generative process, as well as its idiosyncrasies and limitations.

Required Reading for Tuesday:
- TBD reading on data exploration
- *Practical Statistics for Data Scientists* by Bruce, A. and Bruce, P. O'Reilly (2017). Chapter 1: Exploratory Data Analysis [Available Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/ch01.html#EDA)

On Thursday, we’ll describe the components of typical machine learning pipelines. End-to-end ML Pipelines can quickly become unwieldy with several moving pieces and well-structured, modular code is often critical to detecting and fixing bugs in the process.  This session will provide an overview of the pipeline, each underlying element, and some best practices for building them.

Required Reading for Thursday:
- *Architecting a Machine Learning Pipeline* by Koen, S. (Medium) [Available Online](https://towardsdatascience.com/architecting-a-machine-learning-pipeline-a847f094d1c7)

Optional Readings:
- *Data Analysis, Exploratory* by Brillinger. [Available Online](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~brill/Papers/EDASage.pdf)
- *Meet Michelangelo: Uber's Machine Learning Platform* by Hermann, J and Del Balso, M. [Available Online](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/)
