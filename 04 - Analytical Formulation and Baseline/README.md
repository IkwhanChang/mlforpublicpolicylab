Thursday of this week will include the first set of deep dive presentations. At this point in
your project work, you should be developing your initial end-to-end pipeline.

**Due Thursday, Feb. 6:** Project proposal with scope and descriptive statistics.

Distinct from the initial scoping, a true analytical formulation of your policy problem can
only come after you have developed an understanding of the data at hand, which in turn will
often result in a greater understanding of the problem itself. Here, you’ll ask how specifically
your target variable (if relevant) is defined in the data, what types of information are available as predictors, and what baseline you’ll be measure performance against. Very rarely is
the appropriate baseline as simple as "random choice" or the population prevalence. Rather,
it should reflect what would be expected to happen otherwise: perhaps a simple decision rule
that an expert would come up with or even a pre-existing statistical model that the current
effort is seeking to replace.
