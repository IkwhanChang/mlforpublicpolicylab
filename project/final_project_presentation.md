# Final Project Presentation

**NOTE: This is the assignment from last semester for reference. It may change slightly for this semester, but should generally be the same.**

Each team will have 10 minutes for their presentation and 3 minutes for questions:

## Timing
Practice your timing before and have a plan for the last 30 seconds. If you're out of time, what do you want to say in the last 30 seconds?

## Content
The presentation should be clear, well-organized, and at an appropriate level of depth for the decision makers relevant to your project (as opposed to ML experts).

## Suggested Structure

1. What problem are you solving and why is it important?  Be specific about goals, potential policy impact, and efficiency/equity/effectiveness trade-offs (1-2 minutes)
2. What data did you use? (1-2 minutes)
3. Machine Learning Formulation, Analysis, and Evaluation (5 minutes)
 - formulation of the problem
 - what are your rows, what are your labels, what are your features
 - how did you validate - training test splits, evaluation metrics, sensible baseline
 - results: performance, important features, and bias audit
4. Caveats: based on the limitations of your data or analysis (1-2 minutes)
5. Policy Recommendations: concrete recommendations based on your analysis (1-2 minutes)
6. Future Work < 1 minute
