At this point, your group should be continuing to refine and expand on
your preliminary modeling results.  

**Due Thursday, Mar. 19**: Refined feature list

Model interpretability can be thought of at two levels: global (how
the model works in ag- gregate) and local (why an individual
prediction came out as it did). This week, weâ€™ll focus on the bigger
picture: understanding how a model is performing globally and what it
means to compare this performance across model specifications.
