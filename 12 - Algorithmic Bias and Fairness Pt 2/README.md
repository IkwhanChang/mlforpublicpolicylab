During this week, your group should be continuing to investigate any
disparities in your model results as well as performing any other
necessary post-modeling analyses. 

**Due Thursday, Apr. 9**: Draft research proposal section for your final report.

This week, we’ll continue our discussion of bias and fairness with a
very brief survey of practical considerations and open research
questions in the rapidly-developing field.
